## Milestone M1 — Prototype Complete (Local Tool)

**Goal:** Everything works end-to-end on a single machine with no rough edges.

- [x] Claude Code scanner (LAB-RUN-001, LAB-RUN-002)
- [x] Ollama scanner (LAB-RUN-003)
- [x] Cursor scanner (LAB-RUN-004)
- [x] GitHub Copilot scanner (LAB-RUN-005)
- [x] Open Interpreter scanner (LAB-RUN-006)
- [x] OpenClaw scanner — Class D reference implementation (LAB-RUN-007, LAB-RUN-013 local LLM)
- [x] Confidence scoring engine (Appendix B formula)
- [x] Policy engine (ENFORCE-001 through ENFORCE-D03)
- [x] NDJSON emitter + schema validator
- [x] Canonical event schema v0.2.0
- [x] Evasion detection: Co-Authored-By suppression (LAB-RUN-EVASION-001)
- [x] Playbook v0.3 with Class D taxonomy
- [x] React/Vite dashboard (WIP → fixed)
- [x] 5 new scanner modules: Aider, GPT-Pilot, Cline, LM Studio, Continue
- [x] Claude Cowork scanner module (LAB-RUN-014 — VM-based execution, 0.905 confidence)
- [x] Synthetic fixture tests for 5 new scanners (22 tests: Aider, LM Studio, Continue, GPT-Pilot, Cline)
- [ ] Live lab-validate all 5 new scanners (lab run per tool — synthetic validation complete, live runs pending hardware)
- [ ] Schema v0.3.0: add `enforcement.applied` example, finalize enum values
- [ ] Integration tests for `main.py` end-to-end + scanner stubs
- [ ] Playbook v0.4: integrate findings from new lab runs

**Files:** `collector/scanner/`, `collector/tests/`, `dashboard/src/`, `schemas/`, `playbook/`

---

## Milestone M2 — Backend API (Production-Ready Core)

**Goal:** Replace file-based NDJSON pipeline with a real API and database.

- [x] FastAPI backend scaffolded (`api/`)
- [x] PostgreSQL schema: `events`, `endpoints`, `tenants`, `users`, `policies`, `audit_log`
- [x] JWT authentication: register, login, token refresh
- [x] Per-tenant data isolation (row-level filter on `tenant_id`)
- [x] API key support for headless collector agents
- [x] Docker Compose for local dev (API + DB)
- [x] OpenAPI spec auto-generated from FastAPI routes
- [x] Collector HTTP emitter (`collector/output/http_emitter.py`) — POST /events with retry + local buffer fallback
- [x] Persistent endpoint agent daemon (`--interval`, `--api-url`, `--api-key`, `--report-all` flags)
- [x] StateDiffer — change-only reporting with JSON persistence (`collector/agent/state.py`)
- [x] LocalBuffer — offline NDJSON queue flushed on reconnect (`collector/agent/buffer.py`)
- [x] `POST /endpoints/heartbeat` — auto-registers endpoints, updates `last_seen_at`
- [x] OS-level install scripts: macOS LaunchAgent + Linux systemd unit (`install/`)
- [x] Cross-platform abstraction layer (`collector/compat/`) — psutil-backed process, network, service, identity, and path abstraction; macOS/Linux/Windows dispatch; Cursor, Ollama, and Copilot scanners migrated
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Alembic migrations wired up
- [ ] Migrate remaining 8 scanners to compat layer
- [ ] Windows lab validation + Windows Service install script

**Files:** `api/`, `collector/output/`, `collector/agent/`, `collector/compat/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `install/`

---

## Milestone M3 — Frontend SaaS UI

**Goal:** Replace the prototype React app with a production-quality multi-tenant dashboard.

- [x] Auth flows: login, register (JWT with auto-refresh, API key fallback)
- [ ] Auth flows: invite, password reset
- [x] User management: CRUD for tenant users, four-role model (owner/admin/analyst/viewer), Admin page UI
- [ ] Org/tenant management: create org, invite members
- [x] Endpoint management: multi-endpoint view with filter, status, signal bars
- [x] Events dashboard: filterable table, confidence bands, enforcement state, time range
- [x] Policy list (read-only, from API)
- [ ] Policy configuration UI: edit enforcement ladder rules, risky action controls
- [x] Audit log page (read-only, paginated, from API)
- [ ] Alerts and notifications: email or webhook on enforcement state change
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket or polling
- [x] Accessible design (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, screen reader support)
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile breakpoints)

---

## Milestone M4 — SaaS Infrastructure

**Goal:** Deploy to cloud with billing, observability, and security hardening.

- [ ] Cloud deployment: containerized API + frontend (fly.io, Render, or AWS ECS)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline: lint, test, build, deploy on merge to `main`
- [ ] Stripe integration: subscription tiers (free/pro/enterprise), usage metering
- [ ] Secrets management (Doppler or AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Structured logging + distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Privacy review and data retention policy (aligns with INIT-41)
- [ ] Security hardening: rate limiting, input validation, dependency scanning

---

## Milestone M5 — Enterprise Features

**Goal:** Features needed for SOC/enterprise procurement.

- [ ] SSO / SAML 2.0 / OIDC support (auth_provider column and password_reset_required flag in place)
- [ ] SIEM integrations: Splunk HEC, Elastic Beats, Microsoft Sentinel (aligns with INIT-28)
- [ ] Compliance reporting: downloadable audit reports (PDF/CSV)
- [ ] Evasion detection suite (aligns with INIT-29, builds on LAB-RUN-EVASION-001)
- [ ] MITRE ATT&CK tactics mapping (aligns with INIT-40)
- [ ] Multi-region deployment option
- [ ] SLA and support tier documentation

---

## Housekeeping

- [x] `scan-results.ndjson` excluded via `.gitignore` (`*.ndjson`)
- [x] `dashboard/dist/` removed from git tracking
- [x] `.env.example` added to `collector/` and `api/`
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` added
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` added at repo root
- [ ] Push 5 unpushed commits to `origin/main`
- [ ] Triage INIT-28 through INIT-42 shelved issues
- [ ] Add integration tests before M2 merge

## Parking Lot

Items that are valuable but not yet scheduled:

| Item | Ref | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Evasion test suite | INIT-29 | Systematic coverage beyond LAB-RUN-EVASION-001 |
| Replay / simulation mode | INIT-28 | Replay canned events against policy engine |
| Benchmark suite | INIT-31 | Scanner performance, confidence accuracy, FP rate |
| Capability brief | INIT-32 | Customer-facing one-pager; needed before M4 |
| Demo mode | INIT-37 | Canned data for live demos; needed before M4 |
| Deep-dive / positioning | INIT-36 | Market positioning document |
| Metrics pipeline | INIT-30 | Detection rate, FP%, policy coverage KPIs |
| Privacy review | INIT-41 | Data minimization + retention; required before M4 |
| MITRE tactics mapping | INIT-40 | Map signals to ATT&CK for enterprise buyers |
| Lab runs 008–012 (live) | — | Aider, GPT-Pilot, Cline, LM Studio, Continue — synthetic validation complete, live runs pending hardware |
| LAB-RUN-013 findings | — | Local LLM variant: confidence floor for infrastructure-class tools, co-residency detection, model-dependent behavioral weights |
| LAB-RUN-014 findings | — | Claude Cowork: VM-based execution model, 10 GB footprint, cleartext identity, "soft proactive" scheduled tasks, DXT cross-app automation, 0.905 confidence (new highest) |
